        Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid
        revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as
        President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first
        black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative
        democratic election. His administration focused on dismantling
        apartheid's legacy and fostering racial reconciliation. He also
        established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past
        human rights abuses. Mandela's efforts earned him international acclaim
        and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.

      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Nelson Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in the village of Mvezo in
        Umtata, then a part of South Africa's Cape Province. His birth name was
        Rolihlahla Mandela. He later became known by his clan name, Madiba.
      </p>

      <h2>Political Career</h2>
      <p>
        Mandela joined the African National Congress (ANC) in 1943 and became
        actively involved in the anti-apartheid movement. He led peaceful
        protests, strikes, and acts of civil disobedience against the apartheid
        regime.
      </p>

      <h2>Imprisonment</h2>
      <p>
        In 1962, Mandela was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment for his
        anti-apartheid activities. He spent 27 years in prison, most of which
        was on Robben Island.
      </p>

      <h2>Release and Presidency</h2>
      <p>
        Mandela was released from prison in 1990 as apartheid laws were being
        repealed. In 1994, he was elected as South Africa's first black
        president in the country's first multi-racial elections.
      </p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Nelson Mandela is revered worldwide for his tireless efforts to end
        apartheid and promote reconciliation in South Africa. He passed away on
        December 5, 2013, but his legacy continues to inspire people around the
        globe.
