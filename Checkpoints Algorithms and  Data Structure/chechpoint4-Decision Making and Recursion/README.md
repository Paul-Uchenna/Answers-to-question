# Decision Making and Recursion

This repository contains solutions to various decision-making and recursion tasks implemented in JavaScript. Below are the tasks addressed in this repository along with brief descriptions of each:

## Decision Making (if-else and switch):

1. **Leap Year Checker**: A function to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not. Leap years are divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless they are also divisible by 400.

2. **Ticket Pricing**: A program that prompts the user to enter their age and determines the price of a movie ticket based on the following criteria:

   - Children (age <= 12): $10
   - Teenagers (age 13-17): $15
   - Adults (age >= 18): $20

3. **Weather Clothing Adviser**: A program that asks the user for the current temperature and whether it is raining or not. Based on this information, it advises the user on what clothing to wear.

## Recursion:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: A recursive function to generate the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...).

2. **Palindrome Checker**: A recursive function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

3. **Power Function**: A recursive function to calculate the result of raising a number to a given power.
