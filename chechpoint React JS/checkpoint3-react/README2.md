# React State Checkpoint

In this checkpoint, we are going to create our first class-based component and we are going also to create our first state.

## Instructions

1. Create a project using `create-react-app`.
2. Transform `App.js` into a class-based component.
3. Implement state for this class containing an object `Person` with the following properties: `fullName`, `bio`, `imgSrc`, `profession`, and a boolean `show`.
4. Add a button that toggles the display state. When the `show` state is true, the person's profile appears.
5. Create a field that displays the time interval since the last component was mounted using the component's lifecycle.
   - Hint: Use the `setInterval` method.
