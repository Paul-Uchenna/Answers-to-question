# Movie App with React Router

## Overview

In this checkpoint, we are going to enhance the movie app we created in the previous [checkpoint](https://github.com/Paul-Uchenna/Checkpoints/tree/main/chechpoint%20React%20JS/checkpoint4-react) by integrating the router library to handle routing between different views.

## Instructions

1. **Enhance Movie Object**: Add a description and a trailer link (embed video link) to each movie object in the app's data.

2. **Implement Routing**:
   - Set up routes to navigate between different views:
     - **Home Page**: Display a grid of movie cards. Clicking on a movie card should navigate to its description and trailer page.
     - **Description Page**: Show detailed information about the selected movie, including its description and embedded trailer video.
3. **Navigation**:
   - Ensure that users can navigate back to the home page from the description page.
