## Gym Registration Management System User Guide

Welcome to the Gym Registration Management System user guide. This guide provides detailed instructions on how to effectively use the system to manage members and sessions across multiple gyms.

## Checkpoint

You decide to join a very large known gym chain. When you arrive, you go to the reception. You find the owner arguing with a member who wants to attend a session he has not registered for. Your turn finally arrives, the owner apologizes for letting you wait so long. He explains that his employee, in charge of registrations, made a mistake in choosing the member's session.

You are surprised that such a recognized gymnasium still uses the cards to manage its large number of clients. So you're talking to the owner to fix this problem. Interested in your knowledge, he asks you to find him a solution, in return he will offer you a free 3-months inscription.

The owner informs you that:

- he has several gymnasiums which are distinguished by their names, addresses and telephone number.
