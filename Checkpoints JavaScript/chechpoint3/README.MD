What I'm aiming for

For this checkpoint i’ll have to recreate a shopping cart. In this scenario, it’s a cart in which items have already been preselected and from this particular screen the user is able to apply the following instructions:

Instructions

1- Adjust the quantity of each item through “+” and “-” buttons.

2-Delete items from the cart.

3-Like items through a clickable heart-shaped button that will change color accordingly.

4-See the total price adjusted according to quantity and deletions.

“Seamless integration and use of external frameworks or icon toolkits significantly improves the efficiency and aesthetics of web development projects.”
