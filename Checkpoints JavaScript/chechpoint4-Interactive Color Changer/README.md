# Interactive Color Changer

In this project, we will create a simple webpage featuring a color-changing box. This project involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build an interactive interface where users can click a button to change the background color of a box dynamically.

Here's an overview of what we'll accomplish:

1- The HTML file sets up a simple webpage with a heading, a colored box, and a button.

2- The CSS file contains basic styling for the elements.

3- The JavaScript file defines functionality for changing the color of the box when the button is clicked.

4- The getRandomColor() function generates a random hexadecimal color code.

5- When the button is clicked, the getRandomColor() function is called, and the background color of the box (colorBox) is changed to the generated color.

Follow the instructions below:

Instructions

1- HTML Setup:

      * Create a new HTML file.

      * Set up the basic structure of an HTML document with the <!DOCTYPE html>

      * declaration, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.

      * Add a title to the document, such as "Color Changer".

2- Create the Interface:

      * Inside the body tag, create a <div> element with a class name of "container".

      * Inside the container, add an <h1> element with the text "Color Changer".

      * Create another <div> element with an id of "color-box". This will represent the box whose color will change.

      * Add a <button> element with an id of "change-color-btn". The button should have the text "Change Color".

3- Styling with CSS:

      * Create a CSS file and link it to your HTML document using the <link> tag.

      * Style the container class to center its content horizontally and give it some top margin for spacing.

      * Style the color-box id with a fixed width and height, and set a default background color.

      * Style the change-color-btn id to make it visually appealing and easily clickable.

4- JavaScript for Interactivity:

      * Create a JavaScript file and link it to your HTML document using the <script> tag.

      *Write JavaScript code to wait for the DOM content to be loaded using DOMContentLoaded event.

      * Inside the event handler, select the color-box and change-color-btn elements using document.getElementById().

      * Implement a function, let's call it getRandomColor(), which generates a random color. You may use hexadecimal or RGB values.

      * Add an event listener to the change-color-btn element. When clicked, the event listener should trigger a function that changes the background color of the color-box to a random color generated by the getRandomColor() function.

Testing:
Open your HTML file in a web browser.
Click the "Change Color" button and observe the color of the box change dynamically.
