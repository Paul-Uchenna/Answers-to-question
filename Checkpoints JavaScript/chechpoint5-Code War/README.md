Instructions

1- 150 points will be earned from pre-selected problems, covering the basics (loop, conditional, data types, etc..)

2- 150 points will be earned flexibly, allowing me to choose freely the problems to solve (different difficulties reward different points (2, 8, 32, & 128 for the most difficult levels)).

- The pre-selected problems are all beginner level (thus providing 2 points per solution).

PS: Keep in mind that some points are automatically given to the user when ranking up (and other activities not necessarily related to solving problems. A Full explanation of how the points system works can be found here : https://docs.codewars.com/gamification).
